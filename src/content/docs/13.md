## Images üñºÔ∏è

- `src/` - Astro can transform, optimize and bundle them.
- `public/` - avoid any processing or to have a direct public link to them.

```astro
---
// import the Image component and the image
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import myImage from "../assets/my_image.png"; // Image is 1600x900
---

<!-- `alt` is mandatory on the Image component -->
<Image src={myImage} alt="A description of my image." />
```
