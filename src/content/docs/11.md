## Client Directives: "client:\*"

```astro
// Load and hydrate the component JS
// immediately on page load.
<BuyButton client:load />

// once the page is done with its initial load.
<ShowHideButton client:idle />

// when the component is visible in the viewport
// (IntersectionObserver)
<HeavyImageCarousel client:visible />

// CSS media query is met.
<SidebarToggle client:media="(max-width: 50em)" />

// skips HTML server-rendering,
// and renders only on the client.
<SomeReactComponent client:only="react" />
<SomeSvelteComponent client:only="svelte" />
```
