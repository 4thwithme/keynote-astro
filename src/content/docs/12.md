## Animations from the box ðŸŽ‰

Astroâ€™s view transitions support is powered by the new View Transitions browser API and also includes:

- a few built-in animation options (fade, slide).
- forward and backward navigation animations.
- customize animation, and build your own animations.
- option to prevent client-side navigation for non-page links.
- fallback.

```astro
<html transition:animate="none">
  <body>
    <ViewTransitions />
    <!-- Override your page default on a single element -->
    <main transition:animate="slide">
      ...
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```
